    "\n",
    "I queried 2 samples from the LaGuardia/Astoria area 500,000 each of yellow and green taxis in 2015. And then I took smaller samples from Manhattan in the Upper East Side and Midtown areas 30,000 each of yellow and green taxis. With cloud computing or more time, I would take larger queries from more years of data, or even analyze the entire dataset as a whole to understand the totality of taxi behaviour. But for our purposes, this is sufficient and can be run locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "I joined the SQL queries with NYC Open Data GeoJson shape files to eliminate rides in areas we weren’t interested in. Then I performed mathematical operations to determine efficiency, deleted errors, and subsetted the data into the geographical trips I was asked for\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How would you assess the efficiency of aggregating rides within Astoria? From Astoria to Manhattan? From LaGuardia airport, through Astoria, to Manhattan and back?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does this compare to rides within Manhattan?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Would you provide ride shares only within Astoria as new service or also between Astoria and Manhattan? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Would you launch Astoria service during all our hours of operation (24/7) or only for certain hours? If so - which hours? \n",
    "\n",
    "The most distance-efficient place to aggregate rides is in Manhattan. But rides within Astoria, are still comparably distance-efficient, as are rides from Manhattan to Astoria and from LaGuardia to Manhattan. The least distance-efficient rides are from Manhattan to LaGuardia and Astoria to Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rides within Astoria are the least time-efficient, probably that’s because when you’re riding within Astoria you’re not riding on highways and the speed limit on city streets is 25 mph.  The second least time efficient ride is from Astoria to Manhattan. They are much less efficient than rides from Manhattan to Astoria. I’d be interested in examining traffic patterns for this reason. There is probably more traffic getting into Manhattan than there is traffic getting into Astoria. Rides within Manhattan are also relatively time inefficient, I’m guessing for the same reasons rides within Astoria are inefficient. Rides between Manhattan and LaGuardia are most time efficient, probably because more people travel off-peak to and from the Airport, and there’s more fast travel on a highway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riders in Astoria see considerably fewer passengers than in Manhattan, but ridership is more consistent and doesn’t see as sharp a drop from 2-6AM as in Manhattan and overall. I’d probably look at days of the week before deciding when to run the service. ~6pm-1am are peak ridership within Astoria, so that’s a great time range to capitalize on. I would also consider looking at late nights on the weekends until the bars close, and try it out on a pilot program. I don’t think i would start out with morning and daytime rides within Astoria, unless service was very limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'd provide rides only within Astoria, at least during peak hours, because it's relatively distance-efficient, but I'd need to look at overall ridership and financial information to make that determination. Also, rides from Astoria to Manhattan are among the least time and distance efficient, so I would probably avoid branching out into that area. "
